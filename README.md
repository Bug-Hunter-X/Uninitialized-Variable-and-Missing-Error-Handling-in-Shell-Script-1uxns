This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: using an uninitialized variable and neglecting proper error handling. The `bug.sh` script attempts to count the lines in a file but does not check if the file exists or if the `wc` command executes successfully. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The solution, `bugSolution.sh`, provides corrected code with robust error checks.
